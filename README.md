# Hello World

A simple playdate project.

up/down/left/right move the crown around
crank rotates the crown

The PNG is actually black, but i am using setInverted(true). it works when moving left/right. But when rotating the crank (which rotates the image) the line art switches back to non-inverted (if you spin the crank quickly you can see it inverted once again when the image hits a non-rotated axis)


Hit the abutton to invert the background color.
