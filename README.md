# Hello World

A simple playdate project.

When Inverting the line-art drawing, it works when moving left/right. But when rotating the crank (which rotates the image) the line art switches back to non-inverted (if you spin the crank quickly you can see it inverted once again when the image hits a non-rotated axis)
